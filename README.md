# wgpu-benchmark

A simple implementation of a graphics engine that can load 3d models with textures written using  [wgpu](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu). It is used to generate benchmark results for my final year dissertation project in which I compared the performance of [wgpu](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu), [Vulkan](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Hpp) and [Direct3D12](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectX-Graphics-Samples).

# To build
1. Install rust
2. Browse to directory
3. Check paths to model and shaders
4. Run "cargo run" in terminal, this will take a few minutes to download all packages before running
